| --- | --- | --- |
| hadoop.common.configuration.version | 0.23.0 | 此配置文件的版本。 |
| hadoop.tmp.dir | /tmp/hadoop-${user.name} | 其他临时目录的根目录. |
| io.native.lib.available | true | Should native hadoop libraries, if present, be used. |
| hadoop.http.filter.initializers | org.apache.hadoop.http.lib.StaticUserWebFilter | 一个逗号分隔的类名列表。 列表中的每个类都必须 extend org.apache.hadoop.http.FilterInitializer。 相应的过滤器将被初始化。 然后, 该过滤器将应用于所有面向jsp和servlet web页面的用户。 列表的顺序定义了过滤器的顺序。  |
| hadoop.security.authorization | false | 服务级别授权是否启用?  |
| hadoop.security.instrumentation.requires.admin | false | Indicates if administrator ACLs are required to access instrumentation servlets (JMX, METRICS, CONF, STACKS).  |
| hadoop.security.authentication | simple | 可以设置的值为 simple (无认证) 或者 kerberos（一种安全认证系统）  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping | org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback | Class for user to group mapping (get groups for a given user) for ACL. The default implementation, org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback, will determine if the Java Native Interface (JNI) is available. If JNI is available the implementation will use the API within hadoop to resolve a list of groups for a user. If JNI is not available then the shell implementation, ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping, is used. This implementation shells out to the Linux/Unix environment with the bash -c groups command to resolve a list of groups for a user.  |
| fs.client.htrace.sampler.classes |  | The class names of the HTrace Samplers to use for Hadoop filesystem clients.  |
| hadoop.htrace.span.receiver.classes |  | The class names of the Span Receivers to use for Hadoop.  |
| hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs | 300 | This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache containing the user->group mapping. When this duration has expired, then the implementation of the group mapping provider is invoked to get the groups of the user and then cached back.  |
| hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs | 30 | Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate user. Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching.  |
| hadoop.security.groups.cache.warn.after.ms | 5000 | If looking up a single user to group takes longer than this amount of milliseconds, we will log a warning message.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.url |  | The URL of the LDAP server to use for resolving user groups when using the LdapGroupsMapping user to group mapping.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.ssl | false | Whether or not to use SSL when connecting to the LDAP server.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.ssl.keystore |  | File path to the SSL keystore that contains the SSL certificate required by the LDAP server.  |

| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.user | (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={0})) | An additional filter to use when searching for LDAP users. The default will usually be appropriate for Active Directory installations. If connecting to an LDAP server with a non-AD schema, this should be replaced with (&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid={0}). {0} is a special string used to denote where the username fits into the filter. If the LDAP server supports posixGroups, Hadoop can enable the feature by setting the value of this property to "posixAccount" and the value of the hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.group property to "posixGroup".  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.group | (objectClass=group) | An additional filter to use when searching for LDAP groups. This should be changed when resolving groups against a non-Active Directory installation. See the description of hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.user to enable posixGroups support.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.attr.member | member | The attribute of the group object that identifies the users that are members of the group. The default will usually be appropriate for any LDAP installation.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.attr.group.name | cn | The attribute of the group object that identifies the group name. The default will usually be appropriate for all LDAP systems.  |
| hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout | 10000 | The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result. Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired. Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds.  |
| hadoop.security.service.user.name.key |  | For those cases where the same RPC protocol is implemented by multiple servers, this configuration is required for specifying the principal name to use for the service when the client wishes to make an RPC call.  |
| hadoop.security.uid.cache.secs | 14400 | This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache containing the userId to userName and groupId to groupName used by NativeIO getFstat().  |
| hadoop.rpc.protection | authentication | A comma-separated list of protection values for secured sasl connections. Possible values are authentication, integrity and privacy. authentication means authentication only and no integrity or privacy; integrity implies authentication and integrity are enabled; and privacy implies all of authentication, integrity and privacy are enabled. hadoop.security.saslproperties.resolver.class can be used to override the hadoop.rpc.protection for a connection at the server side.  |
| hadoop.security.saslproperties.resolver.class |  | SaslPropertiesResolver used to resolve the QOP used for a connection. If not specified, the full set of values specified in hadoop.rpc.protection is used while determining the QOP used for the connection. If a class is specified, then the QOP values returned by the class will be used while determining the QOP used for the connection.  |
| hadoop.work.around.non.threadsafe.getpwuid | false | Some operating systems or authentication modules are known to have broken implementations of getpwuid_r and getpwgid_r, such that these calls are not thread-safe. Symptoms of this problem include JVM crashes with a stack trace inside these functions. If your system exhibits this issue, enable this configuration parameter to include a lock around the calls as a workaround. An incomplete list of some systems known to have this issue is available at http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/KnownBrokenPwuidImplementations  |
| hadoop.kerberos.kinit.command | kinit | Used to periodically renew Kerberos credentials when provided to Hadoop. The default setting assumes that kinit is in the PATH of users running the Hadoop client. Change this to the absolute path to kinit if this is not the case.  |
| hadoop.security.auth_to_local |  | Maps kerberos principals to local user names  |
| \*io.file.buffer.size | 4096 | 用于顺序文件的缓冲区大小。 这个缓冲区的大小应该是hardware page size的倍数。 (4096 on Intel x86), 它决定了在读和写操作期间缓冲了多少数据。  |

This library could be specified either by by name or the full pathname. In the former case, the library is located by the dynamic linker, usually searching the directories specified in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The value of "system-native" indicates that the default system library should be used. To indicate that the algorithm should operate entirely in Java, specify "java-builtin".  |
| io.serializations | org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.WritableSerialization,org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.avro.AvroSpecificSerialization,org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.avro.AvroReflectSerialization | A list of serialization classes that can be used for obtaining serializers and deserializers.  |
| io.seqfile.local.dir | ${hadoop.tmp.dir}/io/local | The local directory where sequence file stores intermediate data files during merge. May be a comma-separated list of directories on different devices in order to spread disk i/o. Directories that do not exist are ignored.  |
| io.map.index.skip | 0 | Number of index entries to skip between each entry. Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory.  |
| io.map.index.interval | 128 | MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their closest positions in the data file.  |
| fs.defaultFS | file:/// | 默认文件系统的名称。A URI whose scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation. The uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming the FileSystem implementation class. uri的权限用于确定文件系统的主机、端口等。  |

| ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms | 0 | Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds. Currently this timeout works only when ipc.client.ping is set to true because it uses the same facilities with IPC ping.

| dfs.namenode.name.dir.restore | false | Set to true to enable NameNode to attempt recovering a previously failed dfs.namenode.name.dir. When enabled, a recovery of any failed directory is attempted during checkpoint.  |
| dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length | 255 | Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each component of a path. A value of 0 will disable the check.  |
| dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-directory-items | 1048576 | Defines the maximum number of items that a directory may contain. A value of 0 will disable the check.  |
| dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size | 1048576 | Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance.  |
| dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file | 1048576 | Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can degrade performance.  |

If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the transaction file is replicated in all of the directories, for redundancy. Default value is same as dfs.namenode.name.dir  |
| dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir |  | 一个HA集群中多个namenodes之间共享存储的目录。 该目录将由NN编写，并由SNN读取，以保持名称空间的同步。 此目录不需要在dfs.namenode.edits.dir中列出。 它应该在非HA集群中保持为空。  |
| dfs.namenode.edits.journal-plugin.qjournal | org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.qjournal.client.QuorumJournalManager |   |
| dfs.permissions.enabled | true | 如果是true, 在HDFS中启用权限检查。如果是false, 权限检查是关闭的, 但是其他的行为都是不变的。 从一个参数值切换到另一个参数值不会改变模式、所有者或文件组或目录。  |
| dfs.permissions.superusergroup | supergroup | The name of the group of super-users.  |
| dfs.namenode.acls.enabled | false | Set to true to enable support for HDFS ACLs (Access Control Lists). By default, ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the NameNode rejects all RPCs related to setting or getting ACLs.  |
| dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec | 300 | The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key controls the interval between successive scans. Set it to a negative value to disable this behavior.  |
| dfs.block.access.token.enable | false | If "true", access tokens are used as capabilities for accessing datanodes. If "false", no access tokens are checked on accessing datanodes.  |
| dfs.block.access.key.update.interval | 600 | Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.  |
| dfs.block.access.token.lifetime | 600 | The lifetime of access tokens in minutes.  |

| dfs.datanode.data.dir.perm | 700 | Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or symbolic.  |
| dfs.replication | 3 | 数据副本数。 可以在创建文件时指定复制的实际数量。 如果在创建文件时没有指定复制, 则使用默认值。  |
| dfs.replication.max | 512 | Maximal block replication.  |
| dfs.namenode.replication.min | 1 | Minimal block replication.  |
| \*dfs.blocksize | 134217728 | 新文件的默认块大小, 以bytes为单位。 您可以使用以下后缀(大小写不敏感) k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) 指定大小 (比如 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.), 或提供完整的bytes (比如 134217728 for 128 MB).  |
| dfs.client.block.write.retries | 3 | The number of retries for writing blocks to the data nodes, before we signal failure to the application.  |
| dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable | true | If there is a datanode/network failure in the write pipeline, DFSClient will try to remove the failed datanode from the pipeline and then continue writing with the remaining datanodes. As a result, the number of datanodes in the pipeline is decreased. The feature is to add new datanodes to the pipeline. This is a site-wide property to enable/disable the feature. When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default configuration file or disable this feature. Otherwise, users may experience an unusually high rate of pipeline failures since it is impossible to find new datanodes for replacement. See also dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy  |
| dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy | DEFAULT | This property is used only if the value of dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true. ALWAYS: always add a new datanode when an existing datanode is removed. NEVER: never add a new datanode. DEFAULT: Let r be the replication number. Let n be the number of existing datanodes. Add a new datanode only if r is greater than or equal to 3 and either (1) floor(r/2) is greater than or equal to n; or (2) r is greater than n and the block is hflushed/appended.  |
| dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.best-effort | false | This property is used only if the value of dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true. Best effort means that the client will try to replace a failed datanode in write pipeline (provided that the policy is satisfied), however, it continues the write operation in case that the datanode replacement also fails. Suppose the datanode replacement fails. false: An exception should be thrown so that the write will fail. true : The write should be resumed with the remaining datandoes. Note that setting this property to true allows writing to a pipeline with a smaller number of datanodes. As a result, it increases the probability of data loss.  |
| dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec | 21600000 | Determines block reporting interval in milliseconds.  |
| dfs.blockreport.initialDelay | 0 | Delay for first block report in seconds.  |
| dfs.blockreport.split.threshold | 1000000 | If the number of blocks on the DataNode is below this threshold then it will send block reports for all Storage Directories in a single message. If the number of blocks exceeds this threshold then the DataNode will send block reports for each Storage Directory in separate messages. Set to zero to always split.  |
| dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases | 6 | The maximum number of leases for full block reports that the NameNode will issue at any given time. This prevents the NameNode from being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler threads. This number should never be more than the number of RPC handler threads or less than 1.  |
| dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms | 300000 | The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating a full block report lease. This prevents a crashed DataNode from permanently using up a full block report lease.  |
| dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval | 21600 | Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.  |
| dfs.datanode.directoryscan.threads | 1 | How many threads should the threadpool used to compile reports for volumes in parallel have.  |
| dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec | 1000 | The report compilation threads are limited to only running for a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being limited to 100ms, not 25ms. Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%. Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result in the throttle being disbled and an error message being logged. 1000 is the default setting.  |
| dfs.heartbeat.interval | 3 | datanode 心跳间隔 单位秒.  |
| \*dfs.namenode.handler.count | 10 | namenode或jobtracker中用于处理Namenode RPC server的线程数，默认是10，较大集群，可调大些，比如64。 如果没有配置dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address，那么Namenode RPC服务器线程将监听来自所有节点的请求。  |
| dfs.namenode.service.handler.count | 10 | 监听来自DataNodes和所有其他非客户机节点的请求的Namenode RPC服务器线程的数量。dfs.namenode.service.handler.count 只有当dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address被配置时，dfs.namenode.service.handler.count才有效。   |
| dfs.namenode.safemode.threshold-pct | 0.999f | Specifies the percentage of blocks that should satisfy the minimal replication requirement defined by dfs.namenode.replication.min. Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to wait for any particular percentage of blocks before exiting safemode. Values greater than 1 will make safe mode permanent.  |
| dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes | 0 | Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive before the name node exits safemode. Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode during startup. Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster will make safe mode permanent.  |
| dfs.namenode.safemode.extension | 30000 | Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level is reached.  |
| dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval | 5000 | The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs. The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum.  |
| dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved | 104857600 | The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory in bytes. The default is 100MB.  |

| dfs.hosts |  | Names a file that contains a list of hosts that are permitted to connect to the namenode. The full pathname of the file must be specified. If the value is empty, all hosts are permitted.  |
| dfs.hosts.exclude |  | Names a file that contains a list of hosts that are not permitted to connect to the namenode. The full pathname of the file must be specified. If the value is empty, no hosts are excluded.  |
| dfs.namenode.max.objects | 0 | The maximum number of files, directories and blocks dfs supports. A value of zero indicates no limit to the number of objects that dfs supports.  |
| dfs.namenode.datanode.registration.ip-hostname-check | true | If true (the default), then the namenode requires that a connecting datanode's address must be resolved to a hostname. If necessary, a reverse DNS lookup is performed. All attempts to register a datanode from an unresolvable address are rejected. It is recommended that this setting be left on to prevent accidental registration of datanodes listed by hostname in the excludes file during a DNS outage. Only set this to false in environments where there is no infrastructure to support reverse DNS lookup.  |
| dfs.namenode.decommission.interval | 30 | Namenode periodicity in seconds to check if decommission is complete.  |
| dfs.namenode.decommission.nodes.per.interval | 5 | The number of nodes namenode checks if decommission is complete in each dfs.namenode.decommission.interval.  |
| dfs.namenode.replication.interval | 3 | The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes repliaction work for datanodes.  |
| dfs.namenode.accesstime.precision | 3600000 | The access time for HDFS file is precise upto this value. The default value is 1 hour. Setting a value of 0 disables access times for HDFS.  |
| dfs.datanode.plugins |  | Comma-separated list of datanode plug-ins to be activated.  |
| dfs.namenode.plugins |  | Comma-separated list of namenode plug-ins to be activated.  |
| dfs.stream-buffer-size | 4096 | The size of buffer to stream files. The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is buffered during read and write operations.  |
| dfs.bytes-per-checksum | 512 | The number of bytes per checksum. Must not be larger than dfs.stream-buffer-size  |
| dfs.client-write-packet-size | 65536 | Packet size for clients to write  |
| dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis | 600000 | The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes.  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir | file://${hadoop.tmp.dir}/dfs/namesecondary | DSecondarynamenode启动时使用, 放置sn做合并的fsimage及 editlog。 如果这是一个逗号分隔的目录列表, 那么该映像将在所有的冗余目录中复制。  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.edits.dir | ${dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir} | Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS secondary name node should store the temporary edits to merge. If this is a comma-delimited list of directoires then teh edits is replicated in all of the directoires for redundancy. Default value is same as dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period | 3600 | The number of seconds between two periodic checkpoints.  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns | 1000000 | The Secondary NameNode or CheckpointNode will create a checkpoint of the namespace every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns' transactions, regardless of whether 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' has expired.  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.period | 60 | The SecondaryNameNode and CheckpointNode will poll the NameNode every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.period' seconds to query the number of uncheckpointed transactions.  |
| dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries | 3 | The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of retries is limited by this variable.  |
| dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained | 2 | The number of image checkpoint files that will be retained by the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit logs necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained checkpoint will also be retained.  |
| dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained | 1000000 | The number of extra transactions which should be retained beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. This can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained edits in order to start again. Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs. NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained.  |
| dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained | 10000 | The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value.  |

| dfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime | 604800000 | The maximum lifetime in milliseconds for which a delegation token is valid.  |
| dfs.namenode.delegation.token.renew-interval | 86400000 | The renewal interval for delegation token in milliseconds.  |
| dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated | 0 | The number of volumes that are allowed to fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.  |
| dfs.image.compress | false | Should the dfs image be compressed?  |
| dfs.image.compression.codec | org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DefaultCodec | If the dfs image is compressed, how should they be compressed? This has to be a codec defined in io.compression.codecs.  |
| dfs.image.transfer.timeout | 60000 | Socket timeout for image transfer in milliseconds. This timeout and the related dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec parameter should be configured such that normal image transfer can complete successfully. This timeout prevents client hangs when the sender fails during image transfer. This is socket timeout during image tranfer.  |
| dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec | 0 | Maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers (instead of bootstrapping the standby namenode), in bytes per second. This can help keep normal namenode operations responsive during checkpointing. The maximum bandwidth and timeout in dfs.image.transfer.timeout should be set such that normal image transfers can complete successfully. A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. The maximum bandwidth used for bootstrapping standby namenode is configured with dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec.  |
| dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec | 0 | Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby namenode, in bytes per second. A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations. The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.  |
| dfs.image.transfer.chunksize | 65536 | Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint. Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents of image file of huge size.  |
| dfs.namenode.support.allow.format | true | Does HDFS namenode allow itself to be formatted? You may consider setting this to false for any production cluster, to avoid any possibility of formatting a running DFS.  |
| \*dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads | 4096 | 指定用于在DataNode间传输block数据的最大线程数。  |
| dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours | 504 | If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any individual block more than once in the specified scan period. If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled. If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner.  |
| dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second | 1048576 | If this is 0, the DataNode's block scanner will be disabled. If this is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's block scanner will try to scan from each volume.  |
| dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes | 4193404 | While reading block files, if the Hadoop native libraries are available, the datanode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly page data into the operating system buffer cache ahead of the current reader's position. This can improve performance especially when disks are highly contended. This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current read position which the datanode will attempt to read ahead. This feature may be disabled by configuring this property to 0. If the native libraries are not available, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads | false | In some workloads, the data read from HDFS is known to be significantly large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it in the operating system buffer cache. In this case, the DataNode may be configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache after it is delivered to the client. This behavior is automatically disabled for workloads which read only short sections of a block (e.g HBase random-IO workloads). This may improve performance for some workloads by freeing buffer cache spage usage for more cacheable data. If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes | false | In some workloads, the data written to HDFS is known to be significantly large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it in the operating system buffer cache. In this case, the DataNode may be configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache after it is written to disk. This may improve performance for some workloads by freeing buffer cache spage usage for more cacheable data. If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.datanode.sync.behind.writes | false | If this configuration is enabled, the datanode will instruct the operating system to enqueue all written data to the disk immediately after it is written. This differs from the usual OS policy which may wait for up to 30 seconds before triggering writeback. This may improve performance for some workloads by smoothing the IO profile for data written to disk. If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.client.failover.max.attempts | 15 | Expert only. The number of client failover attempts that should be made before the failover is considered failed.  |
| dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis | 500 | Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis milliseconds. And so on.  |
| dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis | 15000 | Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis milliseconds.  |
| dfs.client.failover.connection.retries | 0 | Expert only. Indicates the number of retries a failover IPC client will make to establish a server connection.  |
| dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts | 0 | Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection.  |
| dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout | 30 | Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms. The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.  |
| dfs.nameservices |  | nameservices的逗号分隔列表。  |
| dfs.nameservice.id |  | The ID of this nameservice. If the nameservice ID is not configured or more than one nameservice is configured for dfs.nameservices it is determined automatically by matching the local node's address with the configured address.  |
| dfs.internal.nameservices |  | Comma-separated list of nameservices that belong to this cluster. Datanode will report to all the nameservices in this list. By default this is set to the value of dfs.nameservices.  |
| dfs.ha.namenodes.EXAMPLENAMESERVICE |  | The prefix for a given nameservice, contains a comma-separated list of namenodes for a given nameservice (eg EXAMPLENAMESERVICE).  |
| dfs.ha.namenode.id |  | The ID of this namenode. If the namenode ID is not configured it is determined automatically by matching the local node's address with the configured address.  |
| dfs.ha.log-roll.period | 120 | How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.  |
| dfs.ha.tail-edits.period | 60 | How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should check for new finalized log segments in the shared edits log.  |
| dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled | false | 是否启用了自动故障转移。 有关详细信息,请参阅HDFS HA文档自动HA配置。  |
| dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname | false | Whether clients should use datanode hostnames when connecting to datanodes.  |
| dfs.datanode.use.datanode.hostname | false | Whether datanodes should use datanode hostnames when connecting to other datanodes for data transfer.  |
| dfs.client.local.interfaces |  | A comma separated list of network interface names to use for data transfer between the client and datanodes. When creating a connection to read from or write to a datanode, the client chooses one of the specified interfaces at random and binds its socket to the IP of that interface. Individual names may be specified as either an interface name (eg "eth0"), a subinterface name (eg "eth0:0"), or an IP address (which may be specified using CIDR notation to match a range of IPs).  |
| dfs.datanode.shared.file.descriptor.paths | /dev/shm,/tmp | A comma-separated list of paths to use when creating file descriptors that will be shared between the DataNode and the DFSClient. Typically we use /dev/shm, so that the file descriptors will not be written to disk. Systems that don't have /dev/shm will fall back to /tmp by default.  |
| dfs.short.circuit.shared.memory.watcher.interrupt.check.ms | 60000 | The length of time in milliseconds that the short-circuit shared memory watcher will go between checking for java interruptions sent from other threads. This is provided mainly for unit tests.  |
| dfs.namenode.kerberos.internal.spnego.principal | ${dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal} |   |
| dfs.secondary.namenode.kerberos.internal.spnego.principal | ${dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal} |   |
| dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern | \* | A client-side RegEx that can be configured to control allowed realms to authenticate with (useful in cross-realm env.)  |
| dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode | false | Indicate whether or not to avoid reading from "stale" datanodes whose heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode for more than a specified time interval. Stale datanodes will be moved to the end of the node list returned for reading. See dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode for a similar setting for writes.  |
| dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode | false | Indicate whether or not to avoid writing to "stale" datanodes whose heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode for more than a specified time interval. Writes will avoid using stale datanodes unless more than a configured ratio (dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio) of datanodes are marked as stale. See dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode for a similar setting for reads.  |
| dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval | 30000 | Default time interval for marking a datanode as "stale", i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated as "stale" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode).  |
| dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio | 0.5f | When the ratio of number stale datanodes to total datanodes marked is greater than this ratio, stop avoiding writing to stale nodes so as to prevent causing hotspots.  |
| dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration | 0.32f | *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution. This determines the percentage amount of block invalidations (deletes) to do over a single DN heartbeat deletion command. The final deletion count is determined by applying this percentage to the number of live nodes in the system. The resultant number is the number of blocks from the deletion list chosen for proper invalidation over a single heartbeat of a single DN. Value should be a positive, non-zero percentage in float notation (X.Yf), with 1.0f meaning 100%.  |
| dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration | 2 | *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution. This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer.  |
| nfs.server.port | 2049 | Specify the port number used by Hadoop NFS.  |
| nfs.mountd.port | 4242 | Specify the port number used by Hadoop mount daemon.  |
| nfs.dump.dir | /tmp/.hdfs-nfs | This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory. One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.  |
| nfs.rtmax | 1048576 | This is the maximum size in bytes of a READ request supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you also update the nfs mount's rsize(add rsize= # of bytes to the mount directive).  |
| nfs.wtmax | 1048576 | This is the maximum size in bytes of a WRITE request supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you also update the nfs mount's wsize(add wsize= # of bytes to the mount directive).  |
| nfs.keytab.file |  | *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution. This is the path to the keytab file for the hdfs-nfs gateway. This is required when the cluster is kerberized.  |
| nfs.kerberos.principal |  | *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution. This is the name of the kerberos principal. This is required when the cluster is kerberized.It must be of this format: nfs-gateway-user/nfs-gateway-host@kerberos-realm  |
| nfs.allow.insecure.ports | true | When set to false, client connections originating from unprivileged ports (those above 1023) will be rejected. This is to ensure that clients connecting to this NFS Gateway must have had root privilege on the machine where they're connecting from.  |
| dfs.webhdfs.enabled | true | 在Namenodes和Datanodes中启用WebHDFS(REST API)默认端口50070。  |
| hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout | 300 | The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new connection objects.  |
| hadoop.fuse.timer.period | 5 | The number of seconds between cache expiry checks in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in fuse_dfs noticing changes to Kerberos ticket caches more quickly.  |
| dfs.metrics.percentiles.intervals |  | Comma-delimited set of integers denoting the desired rollover intervals (in seconds) for percentile latency metrics on the Namenode and Datanode. By default, percentile latency metrics are disabled.  |
| dfs.encrypt.data.transfer | false | Whether or not actual block data that is read/written from/to HDFS should be encrypted on the wire. This only needs to be set on the NN and DNs, clients will deduce this automatically. It is possible to override this setting per connection by specifying custom logic via dfs.trustedchannel.resolver.class.  |
| dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.algorithm |  | This value may be set to either "3des" or "rc4". If nothing is set, then the configured JCE default on the system is used (usually 3DES.) It is widely believed that 3DES is more cryptographically secure, but RC4 is substantially faster. Note that if AES is supported by both the client and server then this encryption algorithm will only be used to initially transfer keys for AES. (See dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.cipher.suites.)  |
| dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.cipher.suites |  | This value may be either undefined or AES/CTR/NoPadding. If defined, then dfs.encrypt.data.transfer uses the specified cipher suite for data encryption. If not defined, then only the algorithm specified in dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.algorithm is used. By default, the property is not defined.  |
| dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.cipher.key.bitlength | 128 | The key bitlength negotiated by dfsclient and datanode for encryption. This value may be set to either 128, 192 or 256.  |
| dfs.trustedchannel.resolver.class |  | TrustedChannelResolver is used to determine whether a channel is trusted for plain data transfer. The TrustedChannelResolver is invoked on both client and server side. If the resolver indicates that the channel is trusted, then the data transfer will not be encrypted even if dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is set to true. The default implementation returns false indicating that the channel is not trusted.  |
| dfs.data.transfer.protection |  | A comma-separated list of SASL protection values used for secured connections to the DataNode when reading or writing block data. Possible values are authentication, integrity and privacy. authentication means authentication only and no integrity or privacy; integrity implies authentication and integrity are enabled; and privacy implies all of authentication, integrity and privacy are enabled. If dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is set to true, then it supersedes the setting for dfs.data.transfer.protection and enforces that all connections must use a specialized encrypted SASL handshake. This property is ignored for connections to a DataNode listening on a privileged port. In this case, it is assumed that the use of a privileged port establishes sufficient trust.  |
| dfs.data.transfer.saslproperties.resolver.class |  | SaslPropertiesResolver used to resolve the QOP used for a connection to the DataNode when reading or writing block data. If not specified, the value of hadoop.security.saslproperties.resolver.class is used as the default value.  |
| dfs.datanode.hdfs-blocks-metadata.enabled | false | Boolean which enables backend datanode-side support for the experimental DistributedFileSystem#getFileVBlockStorageLocations API.  |
| dfs.client.file-block-storage-locations.num-threads | 10 | Number of threads used for making parallel RPCs in DistributedFileSystem#getFileBlockStorageLocations().  |
| dfs.client.file-block-storage-locations.timeout.millis | 1000 | Timeout (in milliseconds) for the parallel RPCs made in DistributedFileSystem#getFileBlockStorageLocations().  |
| dfs.journalnode.rpc-address | 0.0.0.0:8485 | JournalNode（日志节点）RPC服务器地址和端口。  |
| dfs.journalnode.http-address | 0.0.0.0:8480 | 日志节点(JournalNode)HTTP服务器监听的地址和端口。 如果端口设置为0，则服务器将从一个空闲端口开始。  |
| dfs.journalnode.https-address | 0.0.0.0:8481 | 日志节点(JournalNode)HTTPS服务器监听的地址和端口。  如果端口设置为0，则服务器将从一个空闲端口开始。  |
| dfs.namenode.audit.loggers | default | List of classes implementing audit loggers that will receive audit events. These should be implementations of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.AuditLogger. The special value "default" can be used to reference the default audit logger, which uses the configured log system. Installing custom audit loggers may affect the performance and stability of the NameNode. Refer to the custom logger's documentation for more details.  |
| dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold | 10737418240 | Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy. This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure round robin basis.  |
| dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-preference-fraction | 0.75f | Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy. This setting controls what percentage of new block allocations will be sent to volumes with more available disk space than others. This setting should be in the range 0.0 - 1.0, though in practice 0.5 - 1.0, since there should be no reason to prefer that volumes with less available disk space receive more block allocations.  |
| dfs.namenode.edits.noeditlogchannelflush | false | Specifies whether to flush edit log file channel. When set, expensive FileChannel#force calls are skipped and synchronous disk writes are enabled instead by opening the edit log file with RandomAccessFile("rws") flags. This can significantly improve the performance of edit log writes on the Windows platform. Note that the behavior of the "rws" flags is platform and hardware specific and might not provide the same level of guarantees as FileChannel#force. For example, the write will skip the disk-cache on SAS and SCSI devices while it might not on SATA devices. This is an expert level setting, change with caution.  |
| dfs.client.cache.drop.behind.writes |  | Just like dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes, this setting causes the page cache to be dropped behind HDFS writes, potentially freeing up more memory for other uses. Unlike dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.client.cache.drop.behind.reads |  | Just like dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this setting causes the page cache to be dropped behind HDFS reads, potentially freeing up more memory for other uses. Unlike dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.client.cache.readahead |  | When using remote reads, this setting causes the datanode to read ahead in the block file using posix_fadvise, potentially decreasing I/O wait times. Unlike dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes, this is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode. If present, this setting will override the DataNode default. When using local reads, this setting determines how much readahead we do in BlockReaderLocal. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.namenode.enable.retrycache | true | This enables the retry cache on the namenode. Namenode tracks for non-idempotent requests the corresponding response. If a client retries the request, the response from the retry cache is sent. Such operations are tagged with annotation @AtMostOnce in namenode protocols. It is recommended that this flag be set to true. Setting it to false, will result in clients getting failure responses to retried request. This flag must be enabled in HA setup for transparent fail-overs. The entries in the cache have expiration time configurable using dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis.  |
| dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis | 600000 | The time for which retry cache entries are retained.  |
| dfs.namenode.retrycache.heap.percent | 0.03f | This parameter configures the heap size allocated for retry cache (excluding the response cached). This corresponds to approximately 4096 entries for every 64MB of namenode process java heap size. Assuming retry cache entry expiration time (configured using dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis) of 10 minutes, this enables retry cache to support 7 operations per second sustained for 10 minutes. As the heap size is increased, the operation rate linearly increases.  |
| dfs.client.mmap.enabled | true | If this is set to false, the client won't attempt to perform memory-mapped reads.  |
| dfs.client.mmap.cache.size | 256 | When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used memory mapped regions. This parameter controls the maximum number of entries that we will keep in that cache. The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially use for memory-mapped files. mmaped files also use virtual address space. You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before increasing the client mmap cache size. Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0.  |
| dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms | 3600000 | The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache between uses. If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody uses it, it will be removed by a background thread.  |
| dfs.client.mmap.retry.timeout.ms | 300000 | The minimum amount of time that we will wait before retrying a failed mmap operation.  |
| dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms | 1800000 | The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode. After this time has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in the cache.  |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.block.map.allocation.percent | 0.25 | The percentage of the Java heap which we will allocate to the cached blocks map. The cached blocks map is a hash map which uses chained hashing. Smaller maps may be accessed more slowly if the number of cached blocks is large; larger maps will consume more memory.  |
| dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory | 0 | The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode will abort on startup. By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching. If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.namenode.list.cache.directives.num.responses | 100 | This value controls the number of cache directives that the NameNode will send over the wire in response to a listDirectives RPC.  |
| dfs.namenode.list.cache.pools.num.responses | 100 | This value controls the number of cache pools that the NameNode will send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC.  |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms | 30000 | The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans. Path cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on what datanodes. By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds.  |
| dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms | 30000 | When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode heartbeat. This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will resend these commands.  |
| dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume | 4 | The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect normal datanode operations.  |
| dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec | 10000 | Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds. After this amount of time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode. The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to DataNode locations. This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default). If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this configuration has no effect.  |
| dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.multiplier.threshold | 2.0 | Determines when an active namenode will roll its own edit log. The actual threshold (in number of edits) is determined by multiplying this value by dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns. This prevents extremely large edit files from accumulating on the active namenode, which can cause timeouts during namenode startup and pose an administrative hassle. This behavior is intended as a failsafe for when the standby or secondary namenode fail to roll the edit log by the normal checkpoint threshold.  |
| dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms | 300000 | How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log, in milliseconds.  |
| dfs.webhdfs.user.provider.user.pattern | ^\[A-Za-z_]\[A-Za-z0-9._-]\*\[$]?$ | Valid pattern for user and group names for webhdfs, it must be a valid java regex.  |
| dfs.client.context | default | The name of the DFSClient context that we should use. Clients that share a context share a socket cache and short-circuit cache, among other things. You should only change this if you don't want to share with another set of threads.  |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit | false | This configuration parameter turns on short-circuit local reads.  |
| dfs.domain.socket.path |  | Optional. This is a path to a UNIX domain socket that will be used for communication between the DataNode and local HDFS clients. If the string "_PORT" is present in this path, it will be replaced by the TCP port of the DataNode.  |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.skip.checksum | false | If this configuration parameter is set, short-circuit local reads will skip checksums. This is normally not recommended, but it may be useful for special setups. You might consider using this if you are doing your own checksumming outside of HDFS.  |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size | 256 | The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors. This parameter controls the size of that cache. Setting this higher will use more file descriptors, but potentially provide better performance on workloads involving lots of seeks.  |
| dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.expiry.ms | 300000 | This controls the minimum amount of time file descriptors need to sit in the client cache context before they can be closed for being inactive for too long.  |
| dfs.datanode.shared.file.descriptor.paths | /dev/shm,/tmp | Comma separated paths to the directory on which shared memory segments are created. The client and the DataNode exchange information via this shared memory segment. It tries paths in order until creation of shared memory segment succeeds.  |
| dfs.namenode.audit.log.debug.cmdlist |  | A comma separated list of NameNode commands that are written to the HDFS namenode audit log only if the audit log level is debug.  |
| dfs.client.use.legacy.blockreader.local | false | Legacy short-circuit reader implementation based on HDFS-2246 is used if this configuration parameter is true. This is for the platforms other than Linux where the new implementation based on HDFS-347 is not available.  |
| dfs.block.local-path-access.user |  | Comma separated list of the users allowd to open block files on legacy short-circuit local read.  |
| dfs.client.domain.socket.data.traffic | false | This control whether we will try to pass normal data traffic over UNIX domain socket rather than over TCP socket on node-local data transfer. This is currently experimental and turned off by default.  |
| dfs.namenode.reject-unresolved-dn-topology-mapping | false | If the value is set to true, then namenode will reject datanode registration if the topology mapping for a datanode is not resolved and NULL is returned (script defined by net.topology.script.file.name fails to execute). Otherwise, datanode will be registered and the default rack will be assigned as the topology path. Topology paths are important for data resiliency, since they define fault domains. Thus it may be unwanted behavior to allow datanode registration with the default rack if the resolving topology failed.  |
| dfs.client.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms | 30000 | The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow io warning in a dfsclient. By default, this parameter is set to 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).  |

In the case a directory has large number of directories and files are deleted, suggested delay is one hour to give the administrator enough time to notice large number of pending deletion blocks and take corrective action.  |
| dfs.namenode.list.encryption.zones.num.responses | 100 | When listing encryption zones, the maximum number of zones that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in batches improves namenode performance.  |
| dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc | 1000 | Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)  |
| dfs.user.home.dir.prefix | /user | The directory to prepend to user name to get the user's home direcotry.  |
| dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms | 900000 | When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums. The DataNode will keep the block file in cache until the client is done. If the client takes an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block file from the cache anyway. This value controls how long the DataNode will wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without checksums.  |
| dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms | 500 | How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache.  |
| dfs.datanode.block.id.layout.upgrade.threads | 12 | The number of threads to use when creating hard links from current to previous blocks during upgrade of a DataNode to block ID-based block layout (see HDFS-6482 for details on the layout).  |

| dfs.storage.policy.enabled | true | Allow users to change the storage policy on files and directories.  |
| dfs.namenode.legacy-oiv-image.dir |  | Determines where to save the namespace in the old fsimage format during checkpointing by standby NameNode or SecondaryNameNode. Users can dump the contents of the old format fsimage by oiv_legacy command. If the value is not specified, old format fsimage will not be saved in checkpoint.  |
| dfs.namenode.top.enabled | true | Enable nntop: reporting top users on namenode  |
| dfs.namenode.top.window.num.buckets | 10 | Number of buckets in the rolling window implementation of nntop  |
| dfs.namenode.top.num.users | 10 | Number of top users returned by the top tool  |
| dfs.namenode.top.windows.minutes | 1,5,25 | comma separated list of nntop reporting periods in minutes  |
| dfs.namenode.blocks.per.postponedblocks.rescan | 10000 | Number of blocks to rescan for each iteration of postponedMisreplicatedBlocks.  |
| dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms | 20000 | The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY. If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump.  |
| dfs.datanode.block-pinning.enabled | false | Whether pin blocks on favored DataNode.  |
| dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout | 20 | The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.  |

| \*mapred.child.java.opts |  | 用于任务流程的Java相关配置，需从应用程序角度进行配置。 下面的符号，如果存在，将被内插: @taskid@ 被当前的TaskID取代。 任何其他的 '@' 出现将不会改变. 例如, 要启用详细gc日志记录到一个文件名为tmp的文件夹并且配置最大对内存为1G, 通过这样配置: -Xmx1024m -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/tmp/@taskid@.gc 配置 -Djava.library.path 使用hadoop本地库会导致程序不再起作用。 These values should instead be set as part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the map / reduce JVM env using the mapreduce.map.env and mapreduce.reduce.env config settings. If -Xmx is not set, it is inferred from mapreduce.{map&#124;reduce}.memory.mb and mapreduce.job.heap.memory-mb.ratio.  |
| mapred.child.env |  | User added environment variables for the task processes. Example : 1) A=foo This will set the env variable A to foo 2) B=$B:c This is inherit nodemanager's B env variable on Unix. 3) B=%B%;c This is inherit nodemanager's B env variable on Windows.  |
| mapreduce.admin.user.env |  | Expert: Additional execution environment entries for map and reduce task processes. This is not an additive property. You must preserve the original value if you want your map and reduce tasks to have access to native libraries (compression, etc). When this value is empty, the command to set execution envrionment will be OS dependent: For linux, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/lib/native. For windows, use PATH = %PATH%;%HADOOP_COMMON_HOME%\\bin.  |
| mapreduce.task.tmp.dir | ./tmp | To set the value of tmp directory for map and reduce tasks. If the value is an absolute path, it is directly assigned.

| mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads | 0 | Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection.  |
| mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed |  | This option can enable/disable using nio transferTo method in the shuffle phase. NIO transferTo does not perform well on windows in the shuffle phase. Thus, with this configuration property it is possible to disable it, in which case custom transfer method will be used. Recommended value is false when running Hadoop on Windows. For Linux, it is recommended to set it to true. If nothing is set then the default value is false for Windows, and true for Linux.  |
| mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size | 131072 | This property is used only if mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case, this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO requests.  |

Users may override this value.  |
| mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps | 9 | Threshold for number of maps, beyond which job is considered too big for the ubertasking optimization. Users may override this value, but only downward.  |
| mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces | 1 | Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered too big for the ubertasking optimization. CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values. (Zero is a valid max, however.) Users may override this value, but only downward.  |
| mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxbytes |  | Threshold for number of input bytes, beyond which job is considered too big for the ubertasking optimization. If no value is specified, dfs.block.size is used as a default. Be sure to specify a default value in mapred-site.xml if the underlying filesystem is not HDFS. Users may override this value, but only downward.  |
| mapreduce.job.emit-timeline-data | false | Specifies if the Application Master should emit timeline data to the timeline server. Individual jobs can override this value.  |
| mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize | 0 | The minimum size chunk that map input should be split into. Note that some file formats may have minimum split sizes that take priority over this setting.  |

It MUST be less than mapreduce.map.maxattempts and mapreduce.reduce.maxattempts otherwise the failed task will never be tried on a different node.  |
| mapreduce.client.output.filter | FAILED | The filter for controlling the output of the task's userlogs sent to the console of the JobClient. The permissible options are: NONE, KILLED, FAILED, SUCCEEDED and ALL.  |
| mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval | 5000 | The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient polls the JobTracker for updates about job status. You may want to set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic.  |
| mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval | 1000 | The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic.  |

This string may contain a single format specifier %s that will be replaced by the path to profile.out in the task attempt log directory. To specify different profiling options for map tasks and reduce tasks, more specific parameters mapreduce.task.profile.map.params and mapreduce.task.profile.reduce.params should be used.  |
| mapreduce.task.profile.map.params | ${mapreduce.task.profile.params} | Map-task-specific JVM profiler parameters. See mapreduce.task.profile.params  |
| mapreduce.task.profile.reduce.params | ${mapreduce.task.profile.params} | Reduce-task-specific JVM profiler parameters. See mapreduce.task.profile.params  |
| mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts | 2 | The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the tasks reports the range of records which it will process next, to the TaskTracker. So that on failures, TT knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions, those are skipped.  |
| mapreduce.job.skip.outdir |  | If no value is specified here, the skipped records are written to the output directory at _logs/skip. User can stop writing skipped records by giving the value "none".  |
| mapreduce.map.skip.maxrecords | 0 | The number of acceptable skip records surrounding the bad record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well. To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the value to 0.

| mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled | false | Specifies whether ACLs should be checked for authorization of users for doing various queue and job level operations. ACLs are disabled by default. If enabled, access control checks are made by JobTracker and TaskTracker when requests are made by users for queue operations like submit job to a queue and kill a job in the queue and job operations like viewing the job-details (See mapreduce.job.acl-view-job) or for modifying the job (See mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job) using Map/Reduce APIs, RPCs or via the console and web user interfaces. For enabling this flag(mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled), this is to be set to true in mapred-site.xml on JobTracker node and on all TaskTracker nodes.  |
| mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job |  | Job specific access-control list for 'modifying' the job. It is only used if authorization is enabled in Map/Reduce by setting the configuration property mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled to true. This specifies the list of users and/or groups who can do modification operations on the job. For specifying a list of users and groups the format to use is "user1,user2 group1,group". If set to '\*', it allows all users/groups to modify this job. If set to ' '(i.e. space), it allows none. This configuration is used to guard all the modifications with respect to this job and takes care of all the following operations: o killing this job o killing a task of this job, failing a task of this job o setting the priority of this job Each of these operations are also protected by the per-queue level ACL "acl-administer-jobs" configured via mapred-queues.xml. So a caller should have the authorization to satisfy either the queue-level ACL or the job-level ACL. Irrespective of this ACL configuration, (a) job-owner, (b) the user who started the cluster, (c) members of an admin configured supergroup configured via mapreduce.cluster.permissions.supergroup and (d) queue administrators of the queue to which this job was submitted to configured via acl-administer-jobs for the specific queue in mapred-queues.xml can do all the modification operations on a job. By default, nobody else besides job-owner, the user who started the cluster, members of supergroup and queue administrators can perform modification operations on a job.  |
| mapreduce.job.acl-view-job |  | Job specific access-control list for 'viewing' the job. It is only used if authorization is enabled in Map/Reduce by setting the configuration property mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled to true. This specifies the list of users and/or groups who can view private details about the job. For specifying a list of users and groups the format to use is "user1,user2 group1,group". If set to '\*', it allows all users/groups to modify this job. If set to ' '(i.e. space), it allows none. This configuration is used to guard some of the job-views and at present only protects APIs that can return possibly sensitive information of the job-owner like o job-level counters o task-level counters o tasks' diagnostic information o task-logs displayed on the TaskTracker web-UI and o job.xml showed by the JobTracker's web-UI Every other piece of information of jobs is still accessible by any other user, for e.g., JobStatus, JobProfile, list of jobs in the queue, etc. Irrespective of this ACL configuration, (a) job-owner, (b) the user who started the cluster, (c) members of an admin configured supergroup configured via mapreduce.cluster.permissions.supergroup and (d) queue administrators of the queue to which this job was submitted to configured via acl-administer-jobs for the specific queue in mapred-queues.xml can do all the view operations on a job. By default, nobody else besides job-owner, the user who started the cluster, memebers of supergroup and queue administrators can perform view operations on a job.  |
| mapreduce.tasktracker.indexcache.mb | 10 | The maximum memory that a task tracker allows for the index cache that is used when serving map outputs to reducers.  |
| mapreduce.job.token.tracking.ids.enabled | false | Whether to write tracking ids of tokens to job-conf. When true, the configuration property "mapreduce.job.token.tracking.ids" is set to the token-tracking-ids of the job  |
| mapreduce.job.token.tracking.ids |  | When mapreduce.job.token.tracking.ids.enabled is set to true, this is set by the framework to the token-tracking-ids used by the job.  |
| mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records | 10000 | The number of records to process during merge before sending a progress notification to the TaskTracker.  |
| mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records | 10000 | The number of records to process during combine output collection before sending a progress notification.  |
| mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps | 0.05 | Fraction of the number of maps in the job which should be complete before reduces are scheduled for the job.  |
| mapreduce.job.complete.cancel.delegation.tokens | true | if false - do not unregister/cancel delegation tokens from renewal, because same tokens may be used by spawned jobs  |
| mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller | org.apache.hadoop.mapred.DefaultTaskController | TaskController which is used to launch and manage task execution  |
| mapreduce.tasktracker.group |  | Expert: Group to which TaskTracker belongs. If LinuxTaskController is configured via mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller, the group owner of the task-controller binary should be same as this group.  |

| mapreduce.job.end-notification.url |  | Indicates url which will be called on completion of job to inform end status of job. User can give at most 2 variables with URI : $jobId and $jobStatus. If they are present in URI, then they will be replaced by their respective values.  |
| mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.attempts | 0 | The number of times the submitter of the job wants to retry job end notification if it fails. This is capped by mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts  |
| mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.interval | 1000 | The number of milliseconds the submitter of the job wants to wait before job end notification is retried if it fails. This is capped by mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval  |
| mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts | 5 | The maximum number of times a URL will be read for providing job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to limit how long after end of a job, the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked as final to prevent users from overriding this.  |

| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.admin.user.env |  | Environment variables for the MR App Master processes for admin purposes. These values are set first and can be overridden by the user env (yarn.app.mapreduce.am.env) Example : 1) A=foo This will set the env variable A to foo 2) B=$B:c This is inherit app master's B env variable.  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts | -Xmx1024m | Java opts for the MR App Master processes. The following symbol, if present, will be interpolated: @taskid@ is replaced by current TaskID. Any other occurrences of '@' will go unchanged. For example, to enable verbose gc logging to a file named for the taskid in /tmp and to set the heap maximum to be a gigabyte, pass a 'value' of: -Xmx1024m -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/tmp/@taskid@.gc Usage of -Djava.library.path can cause programs to no longer function if hadoop native libraries are used. These values should instead be set as part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the map / reduce JVM env using the mapreduce.map.env and mapreduce.reduce.env config settings.  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.admin-command-opts |  | Java opts for the MR App Master processes for admin purposes. It will appears before the opts set by yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts and thus its options can be overridden user. Usage of -Djava.library.path can cause programs to no longer function if hadoop native libraries are used. These values should instead be set as part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the map / reduce JVM env using the mapreduce.map.env and mapreduce.reduce.env config settings.  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.task.listener.thread-count | 30 | The number of threads used to handle RPC calls in the MR AppMaster from remote tasks  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.client.port-range |  | Range of ports that the MapReduce AM can use when binding. Leave blank if you want all possible ports. For example 50000-50050,50100-50200  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.cancel-timeout | 60000 | The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the output committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed  |
| yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.commit-window | 10000 | Defines a time window in milliseconds for output commit operations.

| mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version | 1 | The file output committer algorithm version valid algorithm version number: 1 or 2 default to 1, which is the original algorithm In algorithm version 1, 1. commitTask will rename directory $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/_temporary/$taskAttemptID/ to $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/ 2. recoverTask will also do a rename $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/ to $joboutput/_temporary/($appAttemptID + 1)/$taskID/ 3. commitJob will merge every task output file in $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/ to $joboutput/, then it will delete $joboutput/_temporary/ and write $joboutput/_SUCCESS It has a performance regression, which is discussed in MAPREDUCE-4815. If a job generates many files to commit then the commitJob method call at the end of the job can take minutes. the commit is single-threaded and waits until all tasks have completed before commencing. algorithm version 2 will change the behavior of commitTask, recoverTask, and commitJob. 1. commitTask will rename all files in $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/_temporary/$taskAttemptID/ to $joboutput/ 2. recoverTask actually doesn't require to do anything, but for upgrade from version 1 to version 2 case, it will check if there are any files in $joboutput/_temporary/($appAttemptID - 1)/$taskID/ and rename them to $joboutput/ 3. commitJob can simply delete $joboutput/_temporary and write $joboutput/_SUCCESS This algorithm will reduce the output commit time for large jobs by having the tasks commit directly to the final output directory as they were completing and commitJob had very little to do.  |

For Linux: $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/\*, $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/\*. For Windows: %HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME%/share/hadoop/mapreduce/\*, %HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME%/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/\*. If mapreduce.app-submission.cross-platform is true, platform-agnostic default CLASSPATH for MR applications would be used: {{HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME}}/share/hadoop/mapreduce/\*, {{HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME}}/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/\* Parameter expansion marker will be replaced by NodeManager on container launch based on the underlying OS accordingly.  |

| mapreduce.application.framework.path |  | Path to the MapReduce framework archive. If set, the framework archive will automatically be distributed along with the job, and this path would normally reside in a public location in an HDFS filesystem. As with distributed cache files, this can be a URL with a fragment specifying the alias to use for the archive name. For example, hdfs:/mapred/framework/hadoop-mapreduce-2.1.1.tar.gz#mrframework would alias the localized archive as "mrframework". Note that mapreduce.application.classpath must include the appropriate classpath for the specified framework. The base name of the archive, or alias of the archive if an alias is used, must appear in the specified classpath.  |
| mapreduce.job.classloader | false | Whether to use a separate (isolated) classloader for user classes in the task JVM.  |

| mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size |  | Change the job history cache limit to be set in terms of total task count. If the total number of tasks loaded exceeds this value, then the job cache will be shrunk down until it is under this limit (minimum 1 job in cache). If this value is empty or nonpositive then the cache reverts to using the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size as a job cache size. Two recommendations for the mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size property: 1) For every 100k of cache size, set the heap size of the Job History Server to 1.2GB. For example, mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size=500000, heap size=6GB. 2) Make sure that the cache size is larger than the number of tasks required for the largest job run on the cluster.

| yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms | 900000 | Maximum time to wait to establish connection to ResourceManager.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms | 30000 | How often to try connecting to the ResourceManager.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts | 2 | The maximum number of application attempts. It's a global setting for all application masters. Each application master can specify its individual maximum number of application attempts via the API, but the individual number cannot be more than the global upper bound. If it is, the resourcemanager will override it. The default number is set to 2, to allow at least one retry for AM.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.container.liveness-monitor.interval-ms | 600000 | How often to check that containers are still alive.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.keytab | /etc/krb5.keytab | The keytab for the resource manager.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.delegation-token-auth-filter.enabled | true | Flag to enable override of the default kerberos authentication filter with the RM authentication filter to allow authentication using delegation tokens(fallback to kerberos if the tokens are missing).

| \*yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores | 4 | 最大容器虚拟CPU内核数量。 请求高于此值不会生效，并将被限制为该值。  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.recovery.enabled | false | Enable RM to recover state after starting. 如果是true, then yarn.resourcemanager.store.class must be specified.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.work-preserving-recovery.enabled | false | Enable RM work preserving recovery. This configuration is private to YARN for experimenting the feature.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.work-preserving-recovery.scheduling-wait-ms | 10000 | Set the amount of time RM waits before allocating new containers on work-preserving-recovery. Such wait period gives RM a chance to settle down resyncing with NMs in the cluster on recovery, before assigning new containers to applications.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.store.class | org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStateStore | The class to use as the persistent store. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore is used, the store is implicitly fenced; meaning a single ResourceManager is able to use the store at any point in time. More details on this implicit fencing, along with setting up appropriate ACLs is discussed under yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.state-store.max-completed-applications | ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications} | The maximum number of completed applications RM state store keeps, less than or equals to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. By default, it equals to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. This ensures that the applications kept in the state store are consistent with the applications remembered in RM memory. Any values larger than ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications} will be reset to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. Note that this value impacts the RM recovery performance.Typically, a smaller value indicates better performance on RM recovery.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-address |  | Host:Port of the ZooKeeper server to be used by the RM. This must be supplied when using the ZooKeeper based implementation of the RM state store and/or embedded automatic failover in a HA setting.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries | 1000 | Number of times RM tries to connect to ZooKeeper.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-retry-interval-ms | 1000 | Retry interval in milliseconds when connecting to ZooKeeper. When HA is enabled, the value here is NOT used. It is generated automatically from yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms and yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.parent-path | /rmstore | Full path of the ZooKeeper znode where RM state will be stored. This must be supplied when using org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore as the value for yarn.resourcemanager.store.class  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms | 10000 | ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires. Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat).  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl | world:anyone:rwcda | ACL's to be used for ZooKeeper znodes.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl |  | ACLs to be used for the root znode when using ZKRMStateStore in a HA scenario for fencing. ZKRMStateStore supports implicit fencing to allow a single ResourceManager write-access to the store. For fencing, the ResourceManagers in the cluster share read-write-admin privileges on the root node, but the Active ResourceManager claims exclusive create-delete permissions. By default, when this property is not set, we use the ACLs from yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl for shared admin access and rm-address:random-number for username-based exclusive create-delete access. This property allows users to set ACLs of their choice instead of using the default mechanism. For fencing to work, the ACLs should be carefully set differently on each ResourceManger such that all the ResourceManagers have shared admin access and the Active ResourceManger takes over (exclusively) the create-delete access.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.zk-auth |  | Specify the auths to be used for the ACL's specified in both the yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl and yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl properties. This takes a comma-separated list of authentication mechanisms, each of the form 'scheme:auth' (the same syntax used for the 'addAuth' command in the ZK CLI).  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.uri | ${hadoop.tmp.dir}/yarn/system/rmstore | URI pointing to the location of the FileSystem path where RM state will be stored. This must be supplied when using org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStateStore as the value for yarn.resourcemanager.store.class  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.retry-policy-spec | 2000, 500 | hdfs client retry policy specification. hdfs client retry is always enabled. Specified in pairs of sleep-time and number-of-retries and (t0, n0), (t1, n1), ..., the first n0 retries sleep t0 milliseconds on average, the following n1 retries sleep t1 milliseconds on average, and so on.  |

| yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.enabled | true | Enable automatic failover. By default, it is enabled only when HA is enabled  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.embedded | true | Enable embedded automatic failover. By default, it is enabled only when HA is enabled. The embedded elector relies on the RM state store to handle fencing, and is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with ZKRMStateStore.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.zk-base-path | /yarn-leader-election | The base znode path to use for storing leader information, when using ZooKeeper based leader election.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.cluster-id |  | Name of the cluster. In a HA setting, this is used to ensure the RM participates in leader election for this cluster and ensures it does not affect other clusters  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids |  | The list of RM nodes in the cluster when HA is enabled. See description of yarn.resourcemanager.ha .enabled for full details on how this is used.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id |  | The id (string) of the current RM. When HA is enabled, this is an optional config. The id of current RM can be set by explicitly specifying yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id or figured out by matching yarn.resourcemanager.address.{id} with local address See description of yarn.resourcemanager.ha.enabled for full details on how this is used.  |
| yarn.client.failover-proxy-provider | org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.ConfiguredRMFailoverProxyProvider | When HA is enabled, the class to be used by Clients, AMs and NMs to failover to the Active RM. It should extend org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.RMFailoverProxyProvider  |
| yarn.client.failover-max-attempts |  | When HA is enabled, the max number of times FailoverProxyProvider should attempt failover. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms. When not set, this is inferred from yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms.  |
| yarn.client.failover-sleep-base-ms |  | When HA is enabled, the sleep base (in milliseconds) to be used for calculating the exponential delay between failovers. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.\* settings. When not set, yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms is used instead.  |
| yarn.client.failover-sleep-max-ms |  | When HA is enabled, the maximum sleep time (in milliseconds) between failovers. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.\* settings. When not set, yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms is used instead.  |
| yarn.client.failover-retries | 0 | When HA is enabled, the number of retries per attempt to connect to a ResourceManager. In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries to be used during failover attempts  |
| yarn.client.failover-retries-on-socket-timeouts | 0 | When HA is enabled, the number of retries per attempt to connect to a ResourceManager on socket timeouts. In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during failover attempts  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications | 10000 | The maximum number of completed applications RM keeps.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.delayed.delegation-token.removal-interval-ms | 30000 | Interval at which the delayed token removal thread runs  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.proxy-user-privileges.enabled | false | 如果是true, ResourceManager will have proxy-user privileges. Use case: In a secure cluster, YARN requires the user hdfs delegation-tokens to do localization and log-aggregation on behalf of the user. If this is set to true, ResourceManager is able to request new hdfs delegation tokens on behalf of the user. This is needed by long-running-service, because the hdfs tokens will eventually expire and YARN requires new valid tokens to do localization and log-aggregation. Note that to enable this use case, the corresponding HDFS NameNode has to configure ResourceManager as the proxy-user so that ResourceManager can itself ask for new tokens on behalf of the user when tokens are past their max-life-time.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.am-rm-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs | 86400 | Interval for the roll over for the master key used to generate application tokens  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.container-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs | 86400 | Interval for the roll over for the master key used to generate container tokens. It is expected to be much greater than yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms and yarn.rm.container-allocation.expiry-interval-ms. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanagers.heartbeat-interval-ms | 1000 | The heart-beat interval in milliseconds for every NodeManager in the cluster.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanager.minimum.version | NONE | The minimum allowed version of a connecting nodemanager. The valid values are NONE (no version checking), EqualToRM (the nodemanager's version is equal to or greater than the RM version), or a Version String.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.enable | false | Enable a set of periodic monitors (specified in yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.policies) that affect the scheduler.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.policies | org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.monitor.capacity.ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy | The list of SchedulingEditPolicy classes that interact with the scheduler. A particular module may be incompatible with the scheduler, other policies, or a configuration of either.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.configuration.provider-class | org.apache.hadoop.yarn.LocalConfigurationProvider | The class to use as the configuration provider. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.LocalConfigurationProvider is used, the local configuration will be loaded. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.FileSystemBasedConfigurationProvider is used, the configuration which will be loaded should be uploaded to remote File system first.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled | false | The setting that controls whether yarn system metrics is published on the timeline server or not by RM.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.dispatcher.pool-size | 10 | Number of worker threads that send the yarn system metrics data.  |
| yarn.resourcemanager.max-log-aggregation-diagnostics-in-memory | 10 | Number of diagnostics/failure messages can be saved in RM for log aggregation. It also defines the number of diagnostics/failure messages can be shown in log aggregation web ui.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.hostname | 0.0.0.0 | The hostname of the NM.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.address | ${yarn.nodemanager.hostname}:0 | The address of the container manager in the NM.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.bind-host |  | The actual address the server will bind to. If this optional address is set, the RPC and webapp servers will bind to this address and the port specified in yarn.nodemanager.address and yarn.nodemanager.webapp.address, respectively. This is most useful for making NM listen to all interfaces by setting to 0.0.0.0.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.admin-env | MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=$MALLOC_ARENA_MAX | Environment variables that should be forwarded from the NodeManager's environment to the container's.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist | JAVA_HOME,HADOOP_COMMON_HOME,HADOOP_HDFS_HOME,HADOOP_CONF_DIR,HADOOP_YARN_HOME | Environment variables that containers may override rather than use NodeManager's default.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.container-executor.class | org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.DefaultContainerExecutor | who will execute(launch) the containers.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.container-manager.thread-count | 20 | Number of threads container manager uses.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.delete.thread-count | 4 | Number of threads used in cleanup.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec | 0 | Number of seconds after an application finishes before the nodemanager's DeletionService will delete the application's localized file directory and log directory. To diagnose Yarn application problems, set this property's value large enough (for example, to 600 = 10 minutes) to permit examination of these directories. After changing the property's value, you must restart the nodemanager in order for it to have an effect. The roots of Yarn applications' work directories is configurable with the yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs property (see below), and the roots of the Yarn applications' log directories is configurable with the yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs property (see also below).  |
| yarn.nodemanager.keytab | /etc/krb5.keytab | Keytab for NM.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs | ${hadoop.tmp.dir}/nm-local-dir | List of directories to store localized files in. An application's localized file directory will be found in: ${yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs}/usercache/${user}/appcache/application_${appid}. Individual containers' work directories, called container_${contid}, will be subdirectories of this.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.local-cache.max-files-per-directory | 8192 | It limits the maximum number of files which will be localized in a single local directory. If the limit is reached then sub-directories will be created and new files will be localized in them. If it is set to a value less than or equal to 36 [which are sub-directories (0-9 and then a-z)] then NodeManager will fail to start. For example; [for public cache] if this is configured with a value of 40 ( 4 files + 36 sub-directories) and the local-dir is "/tmp/local-dir1" then it will allow 4 files to be created directly inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache". For files that are localized further it will create a sub-directory "0" inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache" and will localize files inside it until it becomes full. If a file is removed from a sub-directory that is marked full, then that sub-directory will be used back again to localize files.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.localizer.address | ${yarn.nodemanager.hostname}:8040 | Address where the localizer IPC is.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.localizer.cache.cleanup.interval-ms | 600000 | Interval in between cache cleanups.  |

| yarn.nodemanager.localizer.fetch.thread-count | 4 | Number of threads to use for localization fetching.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs | ${yarn.log.dir}/userlogs | Where to store container logs. An application's localized log directory will be found in ${yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs}/application_${appid}. Individual containers' log directories will be below this, in directories named container_{$contid}. Each container directory will contain the files stderr, stdin, and syslog generated by that container.  |
| yarn.log-aggregation-enable | false | Whether to enable log aggregation. Log aggregation collects each container's logs and moves these logs onto a file-system, for e.g. HDFS, after the application completes. Users can configure the "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir" and "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix" properties to determine where these logs are moved to. Users can access the logs via the Application Timeline Server.  |
| yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds | -1 | How long to keep aggregation logs before deleting them. -1 disables. Be careful set this too small and you will spam the name node.  |
| yarn.log-aggregation.retain-check-interval-seconds | -1 | How long to wait between aggregated log retention checks. If set to 0 or a negative value then the value is computed as one-tenth of the aggregated log retention time. Be careful set this too small and you will spam the name node.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.log.retain-seconds | 10800 | Time in seconds to retain user logs. Only applicable if log aggregation is disabled  |
| yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir | /tmp/logs | Where to aggregate logs to.  |

| yarn.nodemanager.vmem-pmem-ratio | 2.1 | 设置内存限制容器时虚拟内存和物理内存的比。 容器分配物理内存方面的表达,并且虚拟内存使用不得超过这个分配比例。 Container allocations are expressed in terms of physical memory, and virtual memory usage is allowed to exceed this allocation by this ratio.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores | 8 | Number of vcores that can be allocated for containers. This is used by the RM scheduler when allocating resources for containers. This is not used to limit the number of physical cores used by YARN containers.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.logaggregation.threadpool-size-max | 100 | Thread pool size for LogAggregationService in Node Manager.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.resource.percentage-physical-cpu-limit | 100 | Percentage of CPU that can be allocated for containers. This setting allows users to limit the amount of CPU that YARN containers use. Currently functional only on Linux using cgroups. The default is to use 100% of CPU.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.webapp.address | ${yarn.nodemanager.hostname}:8042 | NM Webapp address.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.container-monitor.interval-ms | 3000 | How often to monitor containers.  |

| yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.interval-ms | 120000 | Frequency of running disk health checker code.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.min-healthy-disks | 0.25 | The minimum fraction of number of disks to be healthy for the nodemanager to launch new containers. This correspond to both yarn-nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs. i.e. If there are less number of healthy local-dirs (or log-dirs) available, then new containers will not be launched on this node.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.max-disk-utilization-per-disk-percentage | 90.0 | The maximum percentage of disk space utilization allowed after which a disk is marked as bad. Values can range from 0.0 to 100.0. If the value is greater than or equal to 100, the nodemanager will check for full disk. This applies to yarn-nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.disk-utilization-watermark-low-per-disk-percentage |  | The low threshold percentage of disk space used when a bad disk is marked as good. Values can range from 0.0 to 100.0. This applies to yarn-nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs. Note that if its value is more than yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker. max-disk-utilization-per-disk-percentage or not set, it will be set to the same value as yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.max-disk-utilization-per-disk-percentage.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.min-free-space-per-disk-mb | 0 | The minimum space that must be available on a disk for it to be used. This applies to yarn-nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs.  |

| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.hierarchy | /hadoop-yarn | The cgroups hierarchy under which to place YARN proccesses (cannot contain commas). If yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount is false (that is, if cgroups have been pre-configured), then this cgroups hierarchy must already exist and be writable by the NodeManager user, otherwise the NodeManager may fail. Only used when the LCE resources handler is set to the CgroupsLCEResourcesHandler.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount | false | Whether the LCE should attempt to mount cgroups if not found. Only used when the LCE resources handler is set to the CgroupsLCEResourcesHandler.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount-path |  | Where the LCE should attempt to mount cgroups if not found. Common locations include /sys/fs/cgroup and /cgroup; the default location can vary depending on the Linux distribution in use. This path must exist before the NodeManager is launched. Only used when the LCE resources handler is set to the CgroupsLCEResourcesHandler, and yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount is true.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.limit-users | true | This determines which of the two modes that LCE should use on a non-secure cluster. If this value is set to true, then all containers will be launched as the user specified in yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.local-user. If this value is set to false, then containers will run as the user who submitted the application.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.local-user | nobody | The UNIX user that containers will run as when Linux-container-executor is used in nonsecure mode (a use case for this is using cgroups) if the yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.limit-users is set to true.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.user-pattern | ^\[_.A-Za-z0-9]\[-@_.A-Za-z0-9]{0,255}?\[$]?$ | The allowed pattern for UNIX user names enforced by Linux-container-executor when used in nonsecure mode (use case for this is using cgroups). The default value is taken from /usr/sbin/adduser  |
| yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.strict-resource-usage | false | This flag determines whether apps should run with strict resource limits or be allowed to consume spare resources if they need them. For example, turning the flag on will restrict apps to use only their share of CPU, even if the node has spare CPU cycles. The default value is false i.e. use available resources. Please note that turning this flag on may reduce job throughput on the cluster.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.compression-type | none | T-file compression types used to compress aggregated logs.  |
| yarn.nodemanager.principal |  | The kerberos principal for the node manager.  |

| yarn.client.nodemanager-connect.max-wait-ms | 900000 | Max time to wait to establish a connection to NM  |
| yarn.client.nodemanager-connect.retry-interval-ms | 10000 | Time interval between each attempt to connect to NM  |
| yarn.client.max-cached-nodemanagers-proxies | 0 | Maximum number of proxy connections to cache for node managers. If set to a value greater than zero then the cache is enabled and the NMClient and MRAppMaster will cache the specified number of node manager proxies. There will be at max one proxy per node manager. Ex. configuring it to a value of 5 will make sure that client will at max have 5 proxies cached with 5 different node managers. These connections for these proxies will be timed out if idle for more than the system wide idle timeout period. Note that this could cause issues on large clusters as many connections could linger simultaneously and lead to a large number of connection threads. The token used for authentication will be used only at connection creation time. If a new token is received then the earlier connection should be closed in order to use the new token. This and (yarn.client.nodemanager-client-async.thread-pool-max-size) are related and should be in sync (no need for them to be equal). If the value of this property is zero then the connection cache is disabled and connections will use a zero idle timeout to prevent too many connection threads on large clusters.  |

| yarn.nodemanager.container-monitor.procfs-tree.smaps-based-rss.enabled | false | RSS usage of a process computed via /proc/pid/stat is not very accurate as it includes shared pages of a process. /proc/pid/smaps provides useful information like Private_Dirty, Private_Clean, Shared_Dirty, Shared_Clean which can be used for computing more accurate RSS. When this flag is enabled, RSS is computed as Min(Shared_Dirty, Pss) + Private_Clean + Private_Dirty. It excludes read-only shared mappings in RSS computation.  |
| hadoop.registry.rm.enabled | false | Is the registry enabled: does the RM start it up, create the user and system paths, and purge service records when containers, application attempts and applications complete  |
| hadoop.registry.zk.root | /registry |   |
| hadoop.registry.zk.session.timeout.ms | 60000 | Zookeeper session timeout in milliseconds  |

These are given full access to all entries. If there is an "@" at the end of a SASL entry it instructs the registry client to append the default kerberos domain.  |
| hadoop.registry.kerberos.realm |  | The kerberos realm: used to set the realm of system principals which do not declare their realm, and any other accounts that need the value. If empty, the default realm of the running process is used. If neither are known and the realm is needed, then the registry service/client will fail.  |
| hadoop.registry.jaas.context | Client | Key to define the JAAS context. Used in secure mode  |
| yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.roll-monitoring-interval-seconds | -1 | Defines how often NMs wake up to upload log files. The default value is -1. By default, the logs will be uploaded when the application is finished. By setting this configure, logs can be uploaded periodically when the application is running.
